# GeoGebra Discovery Automated Reasoning Tools – A Tutorial

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for creating the official tutorial for GeoGebra Discovery Automated Reasoning Tools.

## PDF version

The latest official PDF version of the tutorial takes place in the
[pdf](pdf) folder. Currently there are English and German
versions. Please feel free to make a copy of [english.tex](english.tex)
and contribute a translation.

## Compilation

We use the command `pdflatex english` and `pdflatex deutsch` twice to
generate the PDF version of the English and German translations.
Alternatively the `make` and `make pdf` commands do the same. The command
`make odt` will create .odt version of the text.

## GeoGebra files

The figures have been created directly by using the desktop version of
GeoGebra Discovery. These sources take place in the [ggb](ggb) folder.

## Planned changes on the Tutorial
* Explain the difference between using axes and switching them off
* Explain the difference between attaching a point to a polygon or a segment
* Add icons
